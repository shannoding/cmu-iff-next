Vinothraj’s first feature-length film presents a stark view of the perils faced by the victims of domestic abuse, while simultaneously casting light on the difficulties endured by communities in South India. An alcoholic, jobless, and abusive man drags his son back to the village of his wife in an attempt to get her to return to him. The film covers the journey of father and son, rife with sweat, smudge, critters, and scorching temperatures, as they travel across the barren landscape. Dramatic, tense, and uneasy energy encompasses each aspect of the film, as even the smallest day-to-day moments teem with complexity. Vinothraj encapsulates the intricacy of familial relationships and social conditions with painstaking detail, providing the viewer with an intimate look at the struggles faced by these underrepresented communities.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Film Trailer</h2>\n<div class=\"trailer-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"580\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M_uARC3Gc64\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>5 Wins and 14 Nominations</em></li>\n<li>Golden Apricot Yerevan International Film Festival – Feature Competition Winner</li>\n<li>Indian Film Festival of Cincinnati – Winner of Best Debut Director</li>\n<li>Rotterdam International Film Festival – Winner of Tiger Award</li>\n<li>Singapore International Film Festival – Winner of Best Director</li>\n<li>Transylvania International Film Festival – Winner of International Competition</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>About the Director</h2>\n<p><img src=\"$basePublicPath$/assets/films/director_headshots/image12.png\" alt=\"Director headshot\"></p>\n<p><strong>Vinothraj P.S.</strong> is an Indian filmmaker who has overcome incredible odds.
