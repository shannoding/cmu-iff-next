Director and French journalist Loup Bureau immersed himself in the grim reality of the conflict, living for months with soldiers in the Donbas region of Ukraine, where the enemy lies just a few kilometers away. Bombs fall, sporadic gunfire is exchanged, and the soldiers continuously dig trenches in the mud-filled land. Filmed in black and white, the film initially comes across as an ode to past conflicts. Now, however, the harsh, unpleasant, and cruel images depicted in the film do not belong rather to present-day reality. Bureau captures the intricacies and difficulties of conflict, while also delving into individuals and their stories, adding an intimate and personal dimension to the bleak horrors of war.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Film Trailer</h2>\n<div class=\"trailer-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"641\" height=\"361\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YgI7h-Gyo2A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>2021 Venice Film Festival</li>\n<li>2021 Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>About the Director</h2>\n<p><img src=\"$basePublicPath$/assets/films/director_headshots/image7.jpg\" alt=\"Director headshot\"></p>\n<p>Born in 1990 in Orvault, France, <strong>Loup Bureau</strong> is a French journalist and filmmaker.
