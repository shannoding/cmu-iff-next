The film carries a notable sense of place, making the urban area a mix of colonial structures, modern buildings and marginalized neighborhoods.\"</p>\n  <p class=\"blockquote-footer\">Los Angeles Times</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Panama’s official submission to the 94th Academy Awards delves into the heartache, isolation, guilt, and detachment accompanying the painful loss of a loved one. The film follows Alicia, a well-off architect working in Panama, as she lives through a substantial loss that pushes her away from society and further into seclusion. The high-class enclave in which Alicia lives is surrounded by some of Panama’s poorest neighborhoods, highlighting the distinct differences and divides that exist between the two worlds. Alicia soon meets Chief, a 13-year-old boy looking after the cars in front of her apartment. Wrapped up in her own swirl of emotions, Alicia has neither the time nor the energy to respond to Chief’s minor attempts at intimidation. Over time the two develop an understanding, until an abrupt change challenges Alicia and demands a response. Will she allow herself to feel emotions and compassion, or will she close her heart off even more and push herself even further away from life?</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Film Trailer</h2>\n<div class=\"trailer-container\">\n    <iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xP_JmBEx1Pg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>3 wins and 1 nomination</em></li>\n<li>Guadalajara International Film Festival – Winner of Best Actor and Best Actress</li>\n<li>International Film Festival of Panama (IFF Panama) – Winner of Audience Award</li>\n<li>Panama's Official Submission to the 94th Academy Awards</li>\n<li>Shortlist, Best International Feature at the 94th Academy Awards</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>About the Director</h2>\n<p><img src=\"$basePublicPath$/assets/films/director_headshots/image5.png\" alt=\"Director headshot\"></p>\n<p>Born in 1971 in Panamá, Panamá, <strong>Aber Benaim</strong> is a Panamanian director, producer, screenwriter, and plastic artist.
