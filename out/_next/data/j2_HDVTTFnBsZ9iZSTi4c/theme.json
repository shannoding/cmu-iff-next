The moment we step onto the pavement, we mask up. Maybe it’s the polite smile to the stranger passing by, or the words we say to get through the day. This year, we wanted looks beyond the smile, beyond the words, beyond the covering we’re conditioned to wear. The mask, whatever form it takes, is what truth hides behind.</p>\n<p>Thus, “FACES BEHIND THE MASK.”</p>\n<p>The masks we wear are integral to how we navigate life, and FACES BEHIND THE MASK seeks to explore the realities they conceal, the facades they represent, and ways we bear them. What masks do we wear, and are we aware of their presence? How do these masks change, day by day, hour by hour, person to person? How can we see through the mask, and get at what is in the dark? Through film, and the privileged perspective it gives us, the CMU IFF hopes to answer these questions, and ask all of us to reflect on our own masks, and their role in our lives.</p>\n","title":"Theme","activeItem":1}},"__N_SSG":true}
