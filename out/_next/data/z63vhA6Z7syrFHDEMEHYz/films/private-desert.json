Daniel’s new day-to-day life is gray, dreary, and mundane as he passes the time by searching for new jobs and engaging in family squabbles. An internet love affair with a woman soon blossoms and transforms Daniel’s outlook on life, until she suddenly falls off the grid. Determined to find her, Daniel drops everything and goes on a cross-country search.  An unexpected meeting—and the subsequent revelation of the truth—shifts perspectives and calls everything into question. Daniel is forced to reexamine himself and his emotions and face his true desires. Aly Muritiba’s <em>Private Desert</em> juxtaposes love and hate, the conservative with the progressive, and shows how a single occurrence can shift long-held viewpoints and bring about radical change.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Film Trailer</h2>\n<div class=\"trailer-container\">\r\n    <iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r75XLMFxscY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>9 Wins &#x26; 3 Nomination</em></li>\n<li>Huelva Latin American Film Festival – Winner of Best Film</li>\n<li>Merlinka Festival – Winner of Best Feature Film</li>\n<li>Recife Cine PE Audiovisual Festival – Winner of Best Film, Best Actor, etc.</li>\n<li>Venice Film Festival – Winner of Best Film</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>About the Director</h2>\n<p><img src=\"$basePublicPath$/assets/films/director_headshots/image4.png\" alt=\"Director headshot\"></p>\n<p><strong>Aly Muritiba</strong> was born in 1979 in Mairi, Brazil.
