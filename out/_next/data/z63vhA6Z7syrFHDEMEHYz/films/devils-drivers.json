As viable work diminishes in their region, two Bedouin cousins attempt to smuggle Palestinian workers across the Negev desert to areas where labor is in high demand. The ever-looming Israeli military presence and surveillance creates a nuanced environment of fear, suspicion, and hostility for the entirety of their journey. The film portrays the motivation and determination to provide for oneself and one’s family, despite knowing the plethora of risks they will face along the way. The film casts an honest light on the treatment of Palestinians by Israeli soldiers, the apprehensive environment in which no one knows who to trust, and the basic human needs and desires driving the action. Through striking camerawork and relentless devotion to capturing the story, directors Abugeth and Carsenty display the same determination as their film’s subjects.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Film Trailer</h2>\n<div class=\"trailer-container\">\r\n    <iframe width=\"574\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1V70sCHjrMA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>2 Nominations</em></li>\n<li>Asia Pacific Screen Awards – Nominee of Best Documentary Feature Film</li>\n<li>Denver International Film Festival – Nominee of Best Documentary</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>About the Director</h2>\n<p><img src=\"$basePublicPath$/assets/films/director_headshots/image14.jpg\" alt=\"Director headshot\"></p>\n<p>Born in 1982 in Frankfurt, Germany, <strong>Daniel Carsenty</strong> is a German director and photographer who found his inspiration to pursue cinema after watching <em>Reservoir Dogs</em>.
