Freda, a university student from a Port-au-Prince neighborhood, navigates her own desires against those of her family. Caught between possibility and tradition, the status quo and the future, Freda's journey is a microcosm of the crossroads Haiti as a nation finds itself. Through its unflinching depiction of women finding a place for themselves when the odds are stacked against them, Freda wonders at what could be, rather than what already is.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Film Trailer</h2>\n<div class=\"trailer-container\">\r\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/623267912?h=a24b3df33d\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/623267912\">FREDA by G&eacute;ssica G&eacute;n&eacute;us - TRAILER</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/sanosiproductions\">SaNoSi Productions</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Cannes Film Festival\n<ul>\n<li>Winner, François Chalais Award - Special Mention</li>\n<li>Nominee, Golden Camera</li>\n<li>Nominee, Un Certain Regard Award</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>IndieLisboa International Independent Film Festival\n<ul>\n<li>Nominee, Grand Prize City of Lisbon</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Miami Film Festival\n<ul>\n<li>Winner, Knight Marimbas Award</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Namur International Festival of French-Speaking Film\n<ul>\n<li>Winner, Audience Award for Best Film</li>\n<li>Winner, Discovery Prize for First Film Competition</li>\n<li>Nominee, Golden Bayard for Best First Film</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ouagadougou Panafrican Film and Television Festival\n<ul>\n<li>Winner, Best Sound</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>About the Director</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/faces/assets/films/director_headshots/freda_dir.jpg\" alt=\"Director headshot\"></p>\n<p><strong>Gessica Généus</strong> began her career as an actress at age 17, with Richard Sénécal’s feature film, <em>Barikad</em>.
