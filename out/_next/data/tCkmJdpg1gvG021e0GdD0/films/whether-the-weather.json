These touches make Whether The Weather Is Fine delicately spellbinding.\"</p>\r\n  <p class=\"blockquote-footer\">New Musical Express</p>\r\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following a destructive and deadly typhoon, the city and the survivors are thrown into disarray and left with scarce supplies and resources. The film centers around three individuals—a mother,  her son, and his girlfriend—as they recover from their losses. Their recovery is cut short when another storm is projected to be heading their way. As they make their way to safety, and perhaps to a new future, differing priorities emerge and threaten to disrupt their journey. Will the trio make their way in time? Or will conflicting agendas crush their chances of survival? In a captivating and artistically-shot portrayal, <em>Whether the Weather is Fine</em> juxtaposes not only the beauty of nature and its deadly powers but also the contending needs and perspectives of individuals.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Film Trailer</h2>\n<div class=\"trailer-container\">\r\n    <iframe width=\"511\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ftnwKicisZc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>8 Wins and 14 Nominations</em></li>\n<li>Guanajuato International Film Festival – Winner of International Feature Competition</li>\n<li>Locarno International Film Festival – Filmmakers of the Present Competition</li>\n<li>Metro Manila Film Festival – Winner of six prizes including best production design</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>About the Director</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/faces/assets/films/director_headshots/image9.png\" alt=\"Director headshot\"></p>\n<p><strong>Carlo Francisco Manatad</strong> was born in 1987 in Tacloban City, Philippines.
