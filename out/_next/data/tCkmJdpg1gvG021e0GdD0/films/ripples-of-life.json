Told from three different perspectives, across three chapters, the film gains different insights into, and perceptions of, the movie-making process and its unique nature. Each chapter presents a distinct viewpoint which naturally complements and contrasts with the others. The first chapter centers around a local woman from the small town in which they are shooting; the second focuses on the star of the movie itself; and the final chapter presents the screenwriter’s view. Through its satire-esque style,<em>Ripples of Life</em> effectively and artistically portrays the frenzied nature of filmmaking against the background of the intertwined stories of the individuals involved.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Film Trailer</h2>\n<div class=\"trailer-container\">\r\n    <iframe width=\"699\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iUyvCRcTVuM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>2 wins and 6 nominations</em></li>\n<li>2021 Cannes Film Festival Directors’ Fortnight</li>\n<li>2021 BFI London Film Festival</li>\n<li>2021 Tokyo FILMeX</li>\n<li>2021 Pingyao International Film Festival [winner of Youth Jury Award &#x26; Best Director]</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>About the Director</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/faces/assets/films/director_headshots/image10.png\" alt=\"Director headshot\"></p>\n<p>Born in 1991 Beijing, China, <strong>Wei Shujun</strong> started his career as an actor at the age of fourteen.
