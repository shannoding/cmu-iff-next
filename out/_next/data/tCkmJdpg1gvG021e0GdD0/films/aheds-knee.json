{"pageProps":{"filmId":"aheds-knee","filmData":{"id":"aheds-knee","contentHtml":"<section>\n<h2>About the Film</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\r\n  <p class=\"mb-0\">\"An abrasive, cinematically bold auto-fiction about a filmmaker fighting off personal, professional and political demons while on a trip to present one of his movies… it’s a film that is certain to please Lapid’s fans, and perhaps garner him some new admirers, though not necessarily one that will win over an audience.\"</p>\r\n  <p class=\"blockquote-footer\">The Hollywood Reporter</p>\r\n</blockquote>\n<p>Israeli filmmaker and artist, Y., arrives in a small town in the arid Arava Valley, where he has been invited to present one of his films. Upon arrival, he meets Yahalom, a deputy director of the Ministry of Culture’s library department and avid admirer of Y. and his work. The pair engage in a constant back and forth, intellectually, physically, and emotionally. The vast, barren desert of the small town is artistically double-captured by Y.’s phone and the camerawork of the film. As a devoted filmmaker, Y. values the honest content of his films, and when the government attempts to censor his work, he pushes back. Will he agree to conform to government-sanctioned topics, going against his own beliefs? Brazen, and oftentimes brash, the film addresses the battle between an artist’s own morals and larger political agendas, while touching on themes of recurring trauma and violence.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Film Trailer</h2>\n<div class=\"trailer-container\">\r\n    <iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_n78JCo0xq0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>1 Win and 9 Nominations</em></li>\n<li>Cannes Film Festival – Winner of Jury Prize</li>\n<li>Cannes Film Festival – Nominee of Palme d’Or</li>\n<li>Seville European Film Festival – Nominee of Best Film</li>\n<li>Awards of the Israeli Film Academy – Nominee of 7 awards including Best Film</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>About the Director</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/faces/assets/films/director_headshots/image1.png\" alt=\"Director headshot\"></p>\n<p><strong>Nadav Lapid</strong> was born in Tel Aviv, Israel in 1975. He has directed three feature films, <em>Policeman</em> (Special Jury Prize at Locarno IFF in 2011), <em>The Kindergarten Teacher</em> (Selected for Cannes’ Critics week in 2014, and which underwent a US remake in 2018), and <em>Synonyms</em> (Golden Bear and Fipresci award at the 2019 Berlinale). All of his films are marked by stark oppositions and combustible reactions when two opposing sides collide. They have won dozens of film prizes internationally. A graduate of the University of Tel Aviv in philosophy and of Israel’s prestigious Sam Spiegel Film &#x26; Television School, Lapid has emerged in just a few years as one of the most promising newcomers in international art cinema. He has also published a collection of short stories, “Keep on Dancing,” translated into several languages.</p>\n</section>\n","excerptHtml":"<p>Event includes discussion moderated by Ralph Vituccio, CMU Entertainment Technology Center, IDeATe, and English Professor and Anouar Rahmani, APF Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University and City of Asylum</p>\n","title":"Ahed’s Knee","runTime":"110 min","country":"Israel / France / Germany","releaseYear":"2021","language":"Hebrew","director":"Nadav Lapid","screening_location":"Harris Theater","screening_time":"April 08 2022 07:30 PM EDT","banner_img_src":"/FilmPage_AhedsKnee.png","director_img_src":"/image1.png","sponsors":["The Jack Buncher Endowed Chair in Jewish Studies in the CMU Department of History","CMU Department of English"],"sponsors_text":"<p>Co-sponsored by The Jack Buncher Endowed Chair in Jewish Studies in the Department of History at Carnegie Mellon University and CMU’s Department of English</p>","hasExcerpt":true},"sponsorsData":[{"link":"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/history/people/faculty/friedman.html","image":"underwriters/Ahed_s Knee/Jack Buncher_Prof_Unitmark_Red_and_Black.jpg","name":"The Jack Buncher Endowed Chair in Jewish Studies in the CMU Department of History","sponsorship_level":"Presenting Partners & Underwriters","sponsorship_level_id":"07-presenting-partners","size":4},{"link":"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/","image":"English_Unitmark_Black_Stacked_Red_and_Black.png","name":"CMU Department of English","sponsorship_level":"Festival Directors","sponsorship_level_id":"05-festival-directors","size":3}]},"__N_SSG":true}
