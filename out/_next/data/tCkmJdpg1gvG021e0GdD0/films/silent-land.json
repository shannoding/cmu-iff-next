Following a tragic accident at the residence, their vacation soon unravels. Artistically subtle, tense, and deliberate, the facade of the blissful couple is slowly unraveled and torn to pieces with each scene. Through a variety of cinematic tools, Woszczyńska establishes a powerful atmosphere of looming fear, with the always-present question of what happens next. <em>Silent Land</em> depicts suppressed emotions, human frailty, and moral downfalls in a poetically portrayed debut film.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Film Trailer</h2>\n<div class=\"trailer-container\">\r\n    <iframe width=\"574\" height=\"323\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f3NR82LIemc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>3 Nominations</em></li>\n<li>Chicago International Film Festival – Nominee of New Directors Competition</li>\n<li>Toronto International Film Festival – Nominee of Platform Prize</li>\n<li>Zurich Film Festival – Nominee of Best International Feature Film</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>About the Director</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/faces/assets/films/director_headshots/image3.png\" alt=\"Director headshot\"></p>\n<p>Born in 1984 in Łódź, Poland, <strong>Agnieszka Woszczyńska</strong> is a director, scriptwriter, and anthropologist.
