Anas, a former rapper, impels his students at the local culture center to use rap as a form of honest expression and a way for them to tell their stories. He challenges them to use their own realities—beset by social unrest, insurmountable odds, and inner turmoil—as the basis of their storytelling, and as a way to project those difficulties back to the world. Through its use of hip-hop music and dance as central modes of protest and free expression, <em>Casablanca Beats</em> seeks to explore what matters now to young people in Morocco, and how they may shape its future.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Film Trailer</h2>\n<div class=\"trailer-container\">\r\n    <iframe width=\"573\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mOdmD50ymfM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>2 Nominations</em></li>\n<li>Morocco Submission for 94th Academy Awards</li>\n<li>Nominee for Palme d'Or, Cannes Film Festival</li>\n<li>Nominee for FIPRESCI Prize, Palm Springs International Film Festival</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>About the Director</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/faces/assets/films/director_headshots/image2.png\" alt=\"Director headshot\"></p>\n<p><strong>Nabil Ayouch</strong> was born in 1969 in Paris, France. His career in filmmaking was inspired by his local cultural center, Forum des Cholettes, where he discovered international film. From there he has gone on to direct nine films, a number of which, including <em>Mektoub</em> (1997), <em>Horses of God</em> (2012), and <em>Casablanca Beats</em> (2021), have represented Morocco at the Academy Awards. He is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma.
