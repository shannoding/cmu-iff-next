	<p>The CMU International Film Festival, now in its 9th edition, aspires to create a dynamic and culturally-charged environment for global perspective on social issues. This year's theme will be "Faces of Work", which is an open invitation to represent the many human challenges, skills, and achievements that  workers may face every day in the world. The theme is open to creative interpretations in every genre. The spirit of the festival is dedicated to the legacy of Paul Goodman, a world-renowned filmmaker, psychologist, and Carnegie Mellon professor.</p>

<p>As a collaborative project between Carnegie Mellon University and the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, the ShortFACES Student Film Competition invites independent student filmmakers from both the local Pittsburgh and greater international spheres to submit a short film of their making into the competition that passionately and creatively captures the festival's particular Faces theme. </p>

<hr />
	<h4 class="subheader">FOR NEXT SEASON</h4>
	<p>Stay tuned! We will be hosting the next edition of the festival Spring of 2016, so information should be released about the next Competition Fall of 2015. We look forward to our next competition and the chance to work with the incredible filmmakers who submit their work. Thank you for a beautiful 2014-2015 Short Film Student Competition. </p>
