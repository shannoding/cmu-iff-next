            <h3><strong>STUDENT SHORT FILM COMPETITION</strong></h3>
            <br>
            <h3>about the competition</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival, sponsored by the Humanities Center at CMU, is proud to present its 2013 theme, Faces of Media. From March 21 - April 13, audiences will have the opportunity to enjoy Pittsburgh premiere screenings of over a dozen brand new and award-winning films from Germany, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Romania, Austria, Finland, Sweden, the Ukraine, Egypt, Iran, Japan, China, and the United States. From the young protestors in Egypt who utilized social media platforms like Facebook to mobilize a revolution to an American community in the near future that maintains social contact through constant live video feeds on individual home computers, the compelling real-life and fictional faces introduced by these films will provoke thoughtful questions about how our global media impacts society and vice versa. Contemporary issues concerning the societal effects of rapid globalized media development, such as violence, (in)justice, identity transformation, voyeurism, obsession, networking, and alienation, will be highlighted in the films through the unique constructs of language, imagery, and narrative.</p><br><p>This year’s Student Short Film Competition, open to all undergraduate and graduate students at accredited institutions, aims to gather perspectives from a group of diverse student filmmakers and animators from across the world. Submissions have to contain an essence of media in theme.</p><br><p>Festival website: www.cmu.edu/faces</p>
