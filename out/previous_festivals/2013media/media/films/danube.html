			<br><br>

			In <i>Danube Hospital</i>, sci-fi and avant-garde meet modern medicine. The setting is Austria&#39s Donauspital, where birth, death, and gore constitute day-to-day activity. Geyrhalter&#39s exquisite shot-compositions aestheticize each unit of the hospital microcosm. One might forget that what they are seeing is documentary footage&#150;imagery of robot-like transporters and state-of-the-art computer technology echo futuristic each is interdependent on the rest, and functions as an integral combination of human and machine. Media screens play a significant role	&#150;it is, after all, through television monitors that we view the stitching of internal organs and an eye surgery. Media is not merely a commercial entity or art form&#150<i>Danube Hospital</i> illustrates its scientific function, its penetration into multiple realms of the contemporary, digitized era.

			<i>Danube Hospital</i> will be preceded by a showing of Dr. Paul Goodman&#39s <i>Nurse</i>. <i>Nurse</i> takes us inside Pittsburgh's very own Mercy Hospital. We are introduced to Cheryl Dinardo, a neo-natal nurse who spends long days and nights treating high-risk infants. Even though she deals daily with situations of life or death, Cheryl remains optimistic and truly devoted to her work. Be sure to stop by <a class="internal" href="http://millergallery.cfa.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Miller Gallery</a> for one last peek at "Imperfect Health: The Medicalization of Architecture!"  Pretzels from <a class="internal" href="http://hofbrauhauspittsburgh.com/" target="_blank">Hofbr&#228;uhaus</a> and kombucha from <a class="internal" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Red-Star-Kombucha/" target="_blank">Red Star Kombucha</a> prior to the screening.
			As part of the Goodman Faces of Work series, the short film examines the daily work-life of one of the health industry&#39s most essential components.  
			<br><br>
			The screening will be followed by a short discussion with Dr. Bea Herbeck Belnap, a researcher at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and with Julia Joy, an Undergraduate Film Studies major at the University of Pittsburgh.
