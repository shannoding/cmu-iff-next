			Even if you do not speak Japanese, you are probably familiar with the mouth-watering word, "sushi." In this documentary, Director Mark Hall guides us through the fascinating world of the global sushi phenomenon. From testimonies by renowned sushi masters in urban Tokyo to fish traders from the vibrant Tsukiji Market, <i>Sushi</I> illustrates determination and professionalism in Japanese culture through this highly industrialized food empire. Traveling to different countries around the globe, Hall examines how sushi becomes integrated into local cultures. While creating an astonishing visual feast, Hall also raises the concern about the industry's sustainability. As the demand for sushi skyrockets, overfishing in certain areas is decreasing supply. This documentary is a delicious, thought-provoking exploration of the state-and future-of the global sushi industry.

			Mark Hall is an independent filmmaker based in Austin, Texas. <i>Sushi: The Global Catch</i> is his first feature-length film project - which was conceived while visiting Warsaw, Poland. Mark was amazed by the popularity of sushi in eastern Europe and viewed the cuisine as emblematic of how economies have rapidly globalized. He was a part of the 'early' days of the Internet, having established the world's largest online education portal in 1998. Mark's experience in media - along with his background in business and law - was a big help in completing <i>Sushi</I>. He attended graduate school in Japan and loves sushi.
