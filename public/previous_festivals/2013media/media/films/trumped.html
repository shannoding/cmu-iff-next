			"<i>You've Been Trumped</I> turns our attention to the ugly truths behind a real estate empire's tacky gleam and reminds us that, unlike the reality-show contestants who'll do anything not to be 'fired,' not all those who face Donald Trump's bullying have submitted to it voluntarily." - <I>The Hollywood Reporter</I>

			What happens when money is more powerful than people? In 2006, Donald Trump purchased an estate on the northeast coast of Scotland, planning to build a complex of golf courses, luxury flats, and a grand hotel. The local council rejected his proposal on account of its threat the area's precious, endangered ecosystem. However, the Scottish government overturned the decision and gave a green light to the development of the complex. This documentary explores the controversy that arose in the wake of this devastating decision and the 21st Century David and Goliath battle that ensued. <I>You've Been Trumped</I> is an entertaining, inspiring, and occasionally disturbing parable of our times and values.
