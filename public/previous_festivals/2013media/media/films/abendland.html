				<I>Abendland</I> takes us behind the scenes of European nightlife -- into a multitude of nighttime settings from a rave, to a hospital, to a porn-shoot, to an airport bathroom. Europe is presented as a fragmented yet cohesive whole, bound together by machine technology. Surveillance is the motif that ties together a variety of seemingly unrelated situations. Director Geyrhalter pays particular attention to London street cameras, meticulously monitored by a team of government employees. Voyeuristic shots are not limited to acts of deviance or crime; rather, the camera shows us people and places that cinematic representations tend to miss. <I>Abendland</I> is a self-reflexive collage examining the complex ways in which media communications help to ensure national security. <a target="blank" class="internal" href="https://www.facebook.com/geyrhalterfilm">@geyrhalterfilm</a>
