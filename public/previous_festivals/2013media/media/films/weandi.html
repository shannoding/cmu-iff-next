			"...an idiosyncratic, funny, unexpectedly poignant snapshot of American youth" - <I>The Hollywood Reporter</I>
			<br><br>
			<i>The We and the I</i> opens with a group of Bronx teenagers boarding a city bus on the last day of school. Before you get too comfortable, rest assured: this is not a sugar-coated high school drama, or a romantic coming-of-age story. <i>The We and the I</I> is a brutally honest portrayal of teenage interactions and the increasing desensitization that surrounds them. The bus is a micro community, and the students are left to their own devices within its confines. They can gossip, flirt, intimidate, deride, humiliate, and alienate as they please. But as the passenger count dwindles, the group dynamic changes and relationships evolve. Director Michel Gondry delivers an artful foray into a world that devalues sincerity and begs for incessant stimulation. <i>The We and the I</I> is truthful, alarming, and absolutely relevant.

			Born in Versailles in 1963, French writer-director Michel Gondry launched into the industry by way of a Bj&ouml;rk music video collaboration. A subsequent slew of music video and commercial work helped Gondry gain respect for the experimental and technologically complex bent of his productions and he made the move to feature filmmaking in 2001. His second feature, <I>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</I> (2004), earned him a Best Original Screenplay Oscar and cemented his status as an auteur with a flair for the witty and surreal. His filmography includes quirky works like <I>The Science of Sleep</I> (2006) and <I>Be Kind Rewind</I> (2008). Gondry's loyal audience awaits the innovation promised by each new project.
